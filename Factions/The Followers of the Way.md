# Political Situation
Living in the caves of the strip-mined moon, posing as religious self-exile in order to escape scrutiny of the Empire. Secretly continuing mining operations deep under the lunar surface.

VERY against [[Gar Saxon]]'s rule as Imperial-appointed governor on Mandalore, where he also served as 

The fundamentalist offshoot of Death Watch that was left behind on Concordia at the end of the Clone Wars. They never accepted Maul as their leader after the defeat of Pre Visla. This caused them to become extremely insular and disdainful of any so-called Mandalorians who would allow an outsider and criminal like Maul to lay claim to the throne of Mandalore.
