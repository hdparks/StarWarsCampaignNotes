## Tricks
### Bad Feeling
When you roll for initiative, you can move up to your speed.
### Uncanny Dodge
When an attacker you can see deals damage with an attack,you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.
### Evasion
When you have to make a DEX save or take half damage, you either take half (fail) or none (success)
### Stealth Master
While hidden, if a being moves into or makes an attack on this beings position, roll a stealth check against the attacker's passive perception. On a success, all attacks miss, and this being remains hidden.
Also on a success, if the attacker is within melee range they provoke opportunity attack
### Sneak Attack
Good ol' sneak attack. 6d6.
### Cloaking Screen
This being can activate the cloaking device on their hip to become invisible for up to 1 minute. Anything this being is wearing or carrying is invisible as log as it remains on their person.
They can activate this ability as a part of their "Bad Feeling" ability when they roll initiative
