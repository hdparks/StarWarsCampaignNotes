What big decision do I want the players to make?
## The Fate of Uldar
Uldar (central system at the heart of the [[Uldaraan Nebula]])
**The New Vegas decision: Who should rule?**
Options:
- Empire, via [[Senator Tiedus Amrena|Tiedus Amrena]]
- Hutts, via [[Qui'mara the Hutt]]
- [[Maison Dubois]]
- [[Tara]]

### Empire
- Legion vibes, threatening cloud on the horizon
- Current leadership all afraid; complete replacement
- Some up-and-comer rivals interested in performing a coup in exchange for a place in the new regime. Lots of suspicion and mistrust.
- Many traders and manufacturers wish Empire was in charge, lower prices and less instability
### Hutts
- NCR vibes
- Some actually good people in charge in the system, trying to do the right thing
- Others are just there to make a quick buck, willing to do anything
- Lots of infighting
- Nothing really gets done, losing every skirmish against Empire probing
- Work with [[Maison Dubois]] to keep the Empire at bay, but are kept on a very short leash while on [[Uldar]].
- They are the primary buyers of [[Uldar]]'s hypermatter, so they want to keep the Empire out as much as they can.
- Can't get the troops and resources they need as the Hutt infighting has become increasingly brutal in the Outer Rim.
### [[Maison Dubois]]
* Mr. House
* Twin King of Uldar
* Leader of Twi'lek Railroad equivalent, helping rescue slaves as well as build a safe harbor. Has teams of agents within Hutt and organizational structures which help Twi'leks to escape from slavery.
* Discovered a secret [[White Spot]], a source of hypermatter, deep within the Uldaaran nebula. As a result, he controls a (currently untapped) source of nearly limitless energy.
* He has hired many of the former Separatist scientists that survived the Clone Wars.
* Working with [[Jenth Iyabor]]. Possible quest: [[Track Down The Cube]]
* Only goal is to build a safe civilization for the Twi'lek people. 
	* Complicated relationship with [[Free Ryloth Movement]]
	* Lots of close ties and history
	* Once got established on Uldar, stopped sending aid: believes Ryloth is too far gone, and that the effort would be better spend building up Uldar as the new capital of the Twi'leki people
* Extremely Dictatorial. Anything less than his vision will not do.
* Unwilling to compromise, to the extent that he exiles those who associate with non-Twi'lek family or friends (Freeside/The Strip)
* Non-Twi'leki are only allowed to live in specific communities, are not allowed to vote, and have extremely limited civil rights
* Scar
