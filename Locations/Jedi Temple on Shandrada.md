Wildlife - Always a bigger fish. 
* The small wildlife, (mice, squirrels, that kinda thing) follow close at hand unless attacked. (**Animal Handling 12**: The rats are looking toward the jungle, not towards you. You suddenly feel like the slowest, meatiest members of a school of fish, huddling together against the threat of larger predators)
- As you approach the temple, the canopy thickens, and the mixing stench of blooming flower and decaying branch, the cycle of life and death, chokes the air. (**Perception 15**: A hundred beady yellow eyes peer out at the party from the dense jungle.)
- The temple itself is vast and ancient, with young vines snaking their way curiously up and in towards the entrance atop the ziggurat. (**Investigation 15**: The bulk of the courtyard stands stalwart against the jungle. Only a handful of young vines have taken root, pushing through the brickwork and disturbing the walkways. Someone used to live here, beating back the jungle. They have been gone for some time.)

Robot cultists - The only survivors are the droid staff, and their primary objective is to ensure that a force user performs the sealing ritual. (Think Institute Synths in ArcJet Lab; you see plenty of their handiwork before they find you.)
