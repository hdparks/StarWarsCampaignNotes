Bonus Action.
Range: 60ft.

A target in range must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw against your Force Casting DC (Dark). On a failed save, the target becomes [[Frightened]] of you. If they fail by more then 5, they must use their next action to dash away from you.

("Ultimate" Move):
Once per battle, if you have successfully frightened 3 targets using the Inspire Fear ability, your enemies learn the true meaning of fear. Every enemy that can see or hear you up to 120 ft. make a Wisdom Saving Throw against your Force Casting DC (Dark). On a failed save, the enemy becomes frightened of you. 

You then make one melee attack against each enemy who is frightened of you, dashing instantly between each target, propelled by the Force. After making these attacks you can end within melee range of any of your targets or return to your original location.
