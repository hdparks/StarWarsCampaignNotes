- Each player starts with 2 "Flashback" points. 
- During a job, a player can pause the action to spend a flashback point and declare a flashback. They explain what their character did to prepare for this situation. The DM then runs the flashback scene like any other to see if they were successful or not.
- A flashback can't change what's already been established, within reason.
- A character can't flashback their own *flashback*. (Inception rule). Someone *else* has to do the nested flashback.
- Spell slots and such need to be accounted for (Track short/long rests).
