---Only use as a backup, [[Playlists#"Star Wars Epic Versions" Ner Cyarika (4h 6min)|this one]] is better
(Best to pick and choose, don't let this one play. Too many iconic ones with actual meaning behind it)

Great generic fallback, huge playlist. Maybe some outliers in there somewhere? Unclear

Very EDM, very high-pressure, really good stuff!
* Start with "Droid Rage" does what it says on the tin, cool droid sounds, starts quiet and builds
* "Neo Tokyo" has some good sitar flavor

I like the Samuel Kim versions cause they are **slightly** different from what we are used to
* Darth Revan - cool place to start, still evocative but none of the super recognizable ones
