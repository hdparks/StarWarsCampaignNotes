## Goals
- Establish Gar Saxon as a politician, and a slimeball that hides behind tradition wherever useful and discards it immediately when it serves him to do so.
- Establish that his stuff is, for the most part, good for Mandalorian wealth on the whole

Grand Moff Tarkin's sharp eyes studied the man in the hologram in front of him. Gar Saxon's suit of Imperial Super Commando Beskar armor still shone with the blood of Mon Calamari insurgents.
_I respect a man who can lead by example_, he thought.
"I trust you were able to restore peace to our facilities on Mon Cala, Commander?"
"Confirmed. We shored up the subaqueous defense grid as well--rotten squids will think twice the next time they assault an Imperial Naval Base."
Tarkin raised one thin eyebrow. "If you've done your job correctly, there will be no 'next time'. Or have your Super Commandos lost their touch?"
Saxon crossed his arms. "We have not. But I'll let our track record speak for itself."
"Indeed", Tarkin agreed. "In fact, the Imperial Super Commando Program continues to produce exceptional results. As such, I'm requisitioning double your current regiment of Commandos, ready for deployment within the next 100 cycles."
Saxon scoffed. Tarkin's brow furrowed, his gaze unyielding. Saxon's jaw clenched, and he relented. "Yes, Grand Moff."
