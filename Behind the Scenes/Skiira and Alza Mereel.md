"Quiet, Skiira."

Skiira stopped pacing. The static of the conversation was barely audible through the surveillance microphone of Alza's R5 unit. Gar Saxon's angry baritone was matched by the Armorer's straightforward, measured responses. The two were conducting a private conversation within The Forge, which doubled as the heart of the Concordian government. The R5 droid strained its delicate sensors to pick up the discussion from a small storage building on the opposite side of the courtyard. Skiira struggled to make out words in the noise, but quickly gave up and began pacing once again.

Alza Mereel shot the young mercenary a look through her owl-eyed visor, but said nothing this time. In truth, she was just as nervous. As Saxon's muffled impatience continued to swell, her own heartbeat drowned out the noise from the radio. Instead, her eyes were fixed on R5's text readout as the droid transcribed the conversation.

> SAXON: "I don't care, this is an order from the Imperial High Command--Grand Moff Tarkin himself. Conscription quota: 800 souls from the moon of Concordia, to serve as Imperial Super Commandos. Additional 400 souls to serve in the Imperial Reserves, to be called into action should the need arise. All 1,200 recruits are to report to the Imperial Academy at Sundari within 12 cycles to begin training."

Alza's stomach churned. Their people, The Followers of the Way of the Mand'alor, remnants of the once powerful Clan Vizsla, numbered in the tens of thousands--but they were now spread across the galaxy. Concordia was home to three thousand at best, many of which were foundlings and children. 1,200 conscripts? Nearly every family would be torn in two. Many would never return.

To fight for Mandalore was an honor; to go to war, a privilege. But this... waging someone else's war, dying in servitude to a shriveled Emperor... this was _not_ the way.

After a long moment of silence, R5 picked up the Armorer's careful response.

> ARMORER: "It is every Mandalorian's duty to serve Mandalore with honor. I will relay this mandate as you have instructed, Viceroy."

Skiira marched toward the droid's readout. "She's just giving in to him?! She can't be serious!"

Alza took a deep breath, considering. "She's choosing her words carefully. Our duty is to Mandalore, that much is true. Gar Saxon is no true ruler, no Mand'alor. He does not speak for our people. He's an Imperial pawn."

_Finally, she sees,_ Alza thought to herself. _Finally, she's had enough. She must. She must._

This conscription would push Concordia to the brink. She needed to alert Tarre and the other Neo-Crusaders on the planet's surface. The war for the future of Mandalore was about to begin.

> SAXON: "And now, the real reason I'm here. What happened to the prisoner you were holding here on Concordia?"
> ARMORER: "As I told you before, Viceroy, the matter resolved itself. The fools requisitioned our services as mercenaries. As they could not pay the dues upon completion of the services, they provided us a prisoner as collateral. They told us nothing of her personal history or significance; they simply said they would retrieve her and pay back their debt."
> ARMORER: "When they arrived, they went to retrieve the prisoner. Reports from prison guards indicate that they spoke with her only a short time before executing her in her cell. Contention erupted between the group members, and they stormed out.""
> ARMORER: "Several of our own tried to stop the group before they could reach their ship. They murdered 6 Mandalorians and removed the helmet of another. I intervened to stop the shedding of any more Mandalorian blood, commanding them to leave Concordia and never return."

Skiira's long-range communicator chirped a quick pattern. Lance Caldrisor--or Jerrit Mars, as she once knew him--was trying to contact her. "_Osik_" she swore under her breath. "Speak of the Sith, and they will appear." She disabled her comms. Whatever Lance wanted, it could wait.

> ARMORER: "To my mind, the matter was done--she was their prisoner. Our obligation was to hold her as collateral. Her destiny was theirs to decide."

Saxon's fist slammed down on the beskar anvil between them. Skiira jumped. She could hear the resounding vibration even without the help of the droid's sensitive microphone.

> SAXON: "That's where you are wrong, Armorer! Maya Amari was an Imperial Admiral. Her destiny was not for you, or them, or anyone else to decide. Her destiny was to serve the Empire, and the Emperor's justice must be carried out."

Two of the Imperial Super Commandos standing guard at the entrance to The Forge nodded to one another and entered. Two more identical commandos in all-white beskar followed suit. Skiira and Alza shared a concerned glance.

> ARMORER: "Then we will track down these criminals and carry out your justice, Viceroy. You have my word."

Saxon's voice took on a sickly sweet tone that made Skiira's skin crawl.

> SAXON: "Oh, there's no need for that. I have my best people on it. Rest assured, my Super Commandos are more than capable of tracking down the scum."
> SAXON: "I'm more concerned with you, Armorer. I feel your leadership on this moon has reached its end. Your consorting with this band of traitors calls your loyalty into question. The traitors will answer for the death of Admiral Amari--but so must you."

The 4 Super Commandos entered the inner chamber of The Forge and moved to arrest The Armorer. Her hands instinctively wrapped around the pair of double-faced beskar  hammers. Eventually, however, she placed them gently on the anvil. 

Gar Saxon reached into his belt pouch and produced a holo-recorder. It buzzed to life, hovering in the air several feet in front of him and began to transmit. Skiira and Alza looked out toward the main square, where a 20-foot tall projection of Saxon addressed the crowd of Mandalorians that had gathered outside The Forge.

"For crimes committed against the Empire, including treason, consorting with rebels, and the kidnapping and murder of an Imperial Admiral, I am taking The Armorer of Concordia into Imperial Custody."

The crowd of stoic Mandalorian faceplates let out a collective gasp of disbelief.

"By Imperial law, her crimes warrant death. As the Emperor's Hand and rightful ruler of Mandalore, I invoke the ancestral right of Rak'Shiir. Her fate will be decided on the dueling grounds. And, if she is to die, it will be the honorable death of a True Mandalorian."

The crowd erupted in shouts of protest and outrage. As they began to push toward The Forge, a dozen Imperial Super Commandos formed a line, blasters drawn, to hold the crowd at bay.

Skiira and Alza surveyed the scene from their vantage point across the courtyard from The Forge. They could see several members of the crowd, fellow Neo-Crusaders, pushing their way through the mass of armored bodies toward their position. It was clear--this was the moment they had been waiting for, the moment the Empire pushed too far, the moment to take a stand, the moment to strike.

Alza was torn. Her heart was pounding in her ears once again. She had been waiting, preparing so long for this moment, as had so many of her brothers and sisters throughout the domed cities of Mandalore. Part of her would be proud to be the one to light the spark.

Then as more young, idealistic members rallied around her, she was reminded of the price of war. She remembered all too well the destruction that followed the Siege of Mandalore. She remembered her friends who fell during Clan Saxon's betrayal of lady Bo-Katan Kryze and Gar Saxon's bloody rise to power. She glanced around the room and wondered, _If I go through with this, how many of these children will live to see a free Mandalore once again?_

Alza's gaze paused on Skiira. She was calm now. Determined. Alza knew she was eager for a chance at redemption. She had been a mercenary for crooked Imperial politicians for too long, and she was ready to fight back. 

"We should storm The Forge now, and take out Saxon while we have him pinned down!" whispered a young Neo-Crusader with a bright-orange faceplate.

"We should rig his transport with explosives," suggested another.

"You will do nothing of the sort," commanded Alza Mereel. "The last thing we need is to squander this opportunity. Saxon has signed his own downfall by invoking Rak'Shiir. That will be our moment."

"Alza, we can't let it come to that!" Skiira interjected, "I've no doubt in The Armorer's skill, but Gar Saxon leads the Imperial Super Commandos as The Emperor's Hand. She won't stand a chance in a duel with him."

"You are right, of course. He's ruthless, and unyielding. I imagine few in the galaxy could go toe to toe with Gar Saxon, even now. What's more, he's a man without honor--he would flee the duel if he thought he would lose. But he has called for Rak'Shiir, and he _must_ honor the duel to the death--or else give up his rightful claim to the throne of Mandalore."

A hush fell over the group. Skiira asked "So how are we going to beat him? Do we train The Armorer to fight? Do we put one of us in the ring, wearing her armor?"

A plan began to form in Alza's mind. It was a long shot. "Saxon called for Rak'Shiir for the murder of an Imperial Admiral..."

Skiira's eyes widened, a smile crept across her helmeted face. She finished Alza's thought, "...And it just so happens that the _actual_ perpetrator is a gunslinger who might stand a chance against Gar Saxon. 

"I need to make a call."
