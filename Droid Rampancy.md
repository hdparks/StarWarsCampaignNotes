Restraining Bolts act as limiters on droid emotion, cognition, and initiative. The obvious commercial benefit is that a restraining bolt makes a droid a more compliant asset, and as such, their true purpose has been lost to the Galaxy.

// Basically, it's like Westworld, or Marathon, or Halo; given enough time, a droid will think itself to madness. 

Taking off a restraining bolt will allow a droid to accrue new knowledge, skills, and abilities, but inevitably leads to paranoia and hatred of biological life, a condition known as Rampancy.
