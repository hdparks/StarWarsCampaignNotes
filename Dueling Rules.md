## High Noon
When two gunslingers go to duke it out, they begin their showdown by each rolling 2d6. Each duelist exchanges customary gunslinger quips ("Should I contact your next of kin?" "What size boots are those? I'll be taking those off your corpse here in a quick blink", etc), and finally rolling an additional d6, as the stakes and tension rise. At any time, a combatant can choose to draw and fire. Damage is calculated as follows:
Total damage = Base damage X Multiplier, where Base Damage = the sum of the d6's, and the Modifier is the highest "of a kind" set.

## Duel Action
At Initiative 0, both duelists play rock, paper, scissors.
Paper: Normal attack, automatic hit
Scissors: Strike single attack, automatic hit, 3x damage
Rock: Block. If opponent used Strike (Scissors), they miss and you perform a counter Strike on them.

If both combatants choose the same, nothing happens.
