Detonates on impact, creating a debilitating shockwave of sonic damage to rupture either the eardrums of biological targets or the sensor arrays of mechanical ones.
- Range: 30 feet + STR * 5 feet (thrown)
- Area: Circle, 10 foot radius
- Each creature within the radius must make a DC 14 CON saving throw or take 2d6 sonic damage and become deafened for the next minute. On a successful save, the target takes half damage and is not deafened.
