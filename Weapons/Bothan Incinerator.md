- Single-use per cartridge, requires an action to reload
- Expends a blast of raw, superheated Tibanna gas in a 15 foot cone
- Targets must make a DC (8 + DEX + Prof) save or take 8d6 fire damage
- All ground inside 15 foot cone becomes difficult terrain, and creatures entering for the first time or ending their turn within the space take 2d6 fire damage until the end of this being's next turn.

Note: Cartridge of Raw Tibanna will run you anywhere from 400 to 800 credits on the gray market. 
Because the Bothans control the Tibanna trade in this corner of the galaxy, they have this kind of resources to burn (literally!), but for the discerning rebel, it might make more sense to trade it out for the refined stuff as blaster ammo.
