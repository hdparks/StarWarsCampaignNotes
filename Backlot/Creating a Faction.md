Hi friends! I know we aren't playing tonight, but it's been a minute, and I thought I'd throw out some (OPTIONAL!) homework for anyone who might wish they were in a Galaxy Far, Far Away today!

Your group just finished the Gala mission and are on their way to meet back up with the rest of the rebel groups above Uldaar.
Your homework, should you choose to accept it, is to come up with a rebel faction. You can get as simple or as complex with it as you want. The only requirement: they have to hate the Empire!

What do they call themselves?
What do they look like?
How big is the group?
Who is their leader?
Where is their base?
How did they become Rebels?

Some examples to get the juices flowing:

The Atom Loth-cats
5 young mine operators that got laid off when the Empire took over their planet. They've retrofitted their mining suits to be fully-functional power armor. Ever since that day, they've never been seen outside their armor. 

or

The Rimefire Clans of Kaldir
A nomadic civilization from the ice planet Kaldir who follow the life-sustaining, ever-shifting power of the massive geo-thermal vents. The Empire is trying to tap the immense power within the core of the planet, but the local Rimefire clans consider that heat to be sacred. They have sworn to defend their home and their birthright. (Basically Fremen, but cold)
