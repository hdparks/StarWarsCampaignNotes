Works like the Empire at War map, showing all planets, who controls them, what's there, and a few actions to take on each one

- planets
    - who's in charge
    - who else is there
    - what does it produce
    - what does it need
    - quests
        - types
            - Smash + Grab (<fist icon>)
            - Sabotage (<sapper charge icon>)
            - Aquisitions (<supply icon>)
            - Fundraising ($-$$$$)
            - Recriutment (<person icon>+)
            - S.O.S. (!!)
            - Establish contact (<base icon>+)
            - Intelligence (<spy icon>)
            - Disturbance in the Force (<jedi icon>)
            - Faction Quest (<faction icon>)

    - regions of influence
        - Empire = red
        - Major Factions = yellow, blue, green, etc.
