### Features
- Daily/weekly new items?
	- Cool idea, but who would it benefit?
	- Actually me. I could curate a master list and have rare things crop up randomly
	- Plus I could override and make sure certain things show up.
- Different places
	- Legit items (healing, clothing, etc.)
	- Grey Market (knives, blasters)
	- Black Market (explosives, etc.)
	- Rebel Contacts (highly specialized, separate channel in Discord?)
	- Finders + Smugglers Guilds (requests for particular items)
