Kyle wants a vision:
- Woman in purple dress
- Chasing through the halls of the Jedi Temple, or similar
- Catch up, it's Maya, but with long hair
	- Seb never saw it that long, she cut it short when she entered the Academy
- Other than the long hair, she looks exactly as she did the last time you saw her, in that cell on Concordia where Lance---
- She takes Seb by the hand, calming his flare of anger, soft smile, talks him down.
