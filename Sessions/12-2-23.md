Boz Pit Stop:
- Stopped by Empire checkpoint "What is the purpose for your visit, business or pleasure?"
	- {Business} "Nature of business: Economic, or Political?"
		- {Economic} "New business venture, or ongoing? If so, whose office can I direct you to?"
		- {Political} "Am I sending you to a particular representative, or straight to the Foreman himself?"
	- {Pleasure} "Hmmm.... Yeah, I hear the steel beam manufactory is beautiful this time of year..." 
	- "(From script) Be sure to check out the Collectivized Techno Guild Museum Presents: The Undoing of the Separatist Droid Army, a retrospective on the inadequacy of waging a war against peace."
- Skako is High-Tech + Manufacturing faction. Could outfit an army, no problem. Just need an army.
- [[Zap Tambor]] hates his suit. It's got Imperial surveillance all over it, and he's gotta be super sneaky.
- Pick up Datacrons (2 MK II Datacrons of Carson's choice)
- Additional custom Datacrons upon completion of the optional goal aboard the science facility

## Tev's Plan
- [[Jenth Iyabor]] asks what you are all up to
	- If you mention breaking in to the facility, Jenth is interested in helping.
	- He knows a Bith on the science team there, and offers schematics and [[Caidissa Harlay]] with her own ship, on one condition: this is his operation now. Tev can still get his cut, but you are to retrieve something else from the other side of the science facility as well.
	 - Jenth also has dirt on the head of security there, can get you in a shield ship and escort however many people you need. Just need to twist a few arms.




## The Heist
[[Imperial Science Facility Nero]]
- The Head of Security is following Jenth's orders: the team is coming in as a visiting oversight committee, consulting scientists, or otherwise interested party.
- The Second in Command is a super Dwight. He's constantly suspicious, first on the comms, then in person. He drills a handful of the crew. If he suspects something going on, he will be passive aggressive, then escalate to verbal reprimand of the Head of Security, then outright mutiny with his two cronies.
