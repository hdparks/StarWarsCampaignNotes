#session

### Pre-session planning

#### General flow:

##### Loot the Armory
Lance loots the Old Armory as stormtroopers start to flood in. Roll to see what crates you open, see how many you can get before the troopers overwhelm

##### Message from Maya

Each being, each object, each empty space has its own "voice" in the Force. This is what allows you, Sabe, to know even if you were blinded and deafened, that it is Maeryn in the back of the ship organizing the new loot, and that Lance is steeling himself for the next mission, and Maggs is busy doing the hyperspace calculations for your next jump to Eriadu. Their unique "voice" in the Force is how you can pick up on their worries, their hopes and fears.

So when you feel a *great* disturbance in the Force that shakes you to your core, you know it's not like the one you felt the day the Jedi Temple fell. This disturbance shakes you--not because of it's size, but because of its shape, its voice, its specific quality: its your voice. Your voice is screaming in pain, in fear, in darkness.

Word has spread that someone else got the Cube. Maya's Mom took their son into the safehouse, but the Crimson Dawn are already on the scene and picking apart the defenses one floor at a time.

Vos sent [[Madjani Geedra]] and his band of thugs to take care of [[Seb's Kiddo]].

##### Getting to [[Eriadu]]
Main street is empty. Tumbleweeds

Shutters peek open and snap shut as the party makes their way toward the main building: the bank

Parked outside are 2 troop carriers and a half-dozen highly modified swoop-bikes.

Sounds of muffled underground explosions echo up from the depths of the unassuming building.

A helmeted head appears in the front window and ducks back after seeing you approach.

At the bottom, Maya's mom is lying on the floor in a pool of her own blood, unconscious.
The elevator is opened, and the red power fields are opening as a jetpack whoooshes out.
Madjani hails the party through the transmitter.
"You three sure know how to ruin an easy score. Sorry I couldn't stay to meet you in person, but I gotta jet. Don't worry about the kid... He'll be taken very good care of. There are Hutts that will give away entire planets to buy a freak like this. Precious cargo, for sure."

###### Questions for Sabe - 
-   Getting up through the elevator shaft
    -   What would you do to save your son?
-   Catching up to the jetpacking man as he docks with the gunboat
    -   How hard would you push yourself to save your son?
-   Cutting through the wall of gunfire, still running toward the gunboat as it pulls away
    -   What would you sacrifice to save your son?
-   Obliterating everyone on board
    -   What would you become to save your son?

###### Sabe's Knife twist
-   If he chooses to go full evil, his son recoils in horror
-   As the bodies of his enemies come to rest, Sabe's old Jedi friend [[Ahsoka Tano]] appears on the horizon
-   "What have you done?"
-   "What have you become?"
-   She looks at the child, and sorrow fills her eyes.
-   "My old friend.... You always were one to push the limits. But you've become entirely untethered, succumbed to every whim of the dark side that you've let control you."
-   Sabe, you do feel that complete severance to the light side of the Force. But with it comes an exhilarating liberation as the dark side courses through you. You can no longer use any force abilities that are marked as "Light Side"
