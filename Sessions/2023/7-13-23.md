#### Scenes:

Mandalorian Meetup - 
- [[Skiira]] rushes to hug her brother. Apologies for not believing.
- [[Skiira]] takes off her helmet, other mandos get awkward, avert their gaze except for [[The Armorer]] in the red armor and gold helmet. [[Din Djarin]], a teenage Mandalorian in a silver helmet, shakes his head and turns to go back to the ship.
- [[Ruus]] to [Jerit](Lance.md) "It's good to see you alive, brother"
- [[The Armorer]] to the party: "You have done well. Your reputation proceeds you, Jerrit Mars, and I commend you for your bravery. We do not lightly place our faith in those outside the tribe."
- "You must be weary from your battles. We will leave you now to rest. In one week, meet us at these coordinates on the moon of [[Locations/Concordia]]. There, we will settle the matter of payment."
- "We will meet again in one week. Welcome back to the galaxy, Jerrit Mars."

Later that night - 
- [Mags](obsidian://open?vault=SW&file=Magganni%20%22Mags%22) can't wait to get [[The Cube]] back to Rebel command back on [[Haruun Kal]] at the [[Alcazar Cantina]] hideout.
* While traveling through space, several members receive their encoded messages.
* If Maya wakes up, she's gonna freak the eff out. "I'll tear you and every inch of this ship to pieces. WHERE IS IT".
* I want Lance to get to the scene first. He's already suspicious. He doesn't know the history. I wanna use that to ratchet up the freaking TENSION.
* If Lance goes for a kill, Sabe gets bullet time. Lance describes in super slow motion every action, and Sabe feels it all in the force.
* When she sees Sabe, conflicting emotions: shock, confusion, suspicion, and finally just anger.
* "They found him. I did what you said, I thought he would be safe with my mother YOU TOLD ME HE WOULD BE SAFE."
* "And YOU! It's been nearly TWO YEARS"
* "Why are you here? How?... What is happening here?"
* "Take me back. Take me to the nearest Imperial outpost, or your funny friend here has seen her last sunrise. Don't try me."

Where it COULD go - 

	[[Alcazar Cantina]], [[Haruun Kal]] (Mags, Lance, and Mae all want to go here)
	
		[[ISB Handler Auger]] - Wants it from Mae to get all the credit. Working with the Hutts, but double-crossed them. He originally set up [[Tev]]'s escape plan, but it's been slipping ever since. He's getting desperate, but if it works out, he can afford to cover up Maeryn's escape.

		[[Caidissa Harlay]] - Wants it from Jerrit to return to the [[The Hutts]]. Is using [[Jenth Iyabor]], cause he is super down bad for her. Owns one of the cool guns Jerrit wants (DG-34 Peacemaker Heavy Blaster).
		Hits on Jerrit, hard, in a menacing way.
		"I believe this key belongs to you. Trust me... I wouldn't need this if I wanted to make you weak in the knees.""

		[[Maya]] - They'll have to figure out something. She's not someone you tell to "stay in the ship".

	[[Mustafar]]
		They could end up going along with Maya and deliver the cube to Mustafar so that their son won't be killed by Dryden Vos. Maya would demand they drop her off at an outpost on a neighboring system (no need to get too close to Vader just yet.) If they let her have the cube, she will leave them in peace, and beg Sabe to check in on the boy. If they don't leave her with the cube, she will call in EVERYTHING, big space escape.

	[[Eriadu]]
		If they chose to go save Sabe's son, Dryden Vos's cronies are waiting. There are a whole bunch in the town, and more just keep flooding through.
		At the end, the kid force-chokes the nanny? Some dramatic reveal of his force powers, especially in the dark side.

### Post-Session Notes:
[[Maya Amari]] tried to take [[Magganni "Mags"]] hostage. The team stopped her. They are going to work together to fight off Dryden Vos's men and rescue Sabe's kiddo on [[Eriadu]]. First though, they are going to get rid of [[The Cube]]. It's unclear whether they will give it to [[ISB Handler Auger]] or [[Jenth Iyabor]] or the Rebellion leadership.
