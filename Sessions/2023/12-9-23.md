- Seb has a vision:
	- "What was that Mace Windu thing?"
	- Shatterpoint scenes:
		- Lance: a different enemy in each shard, all turn to shoot him at once
		- Boz: his friends are swallowed by a shadow that returns for him once more
		- Tara: on a farm, shadow consuming the land as a Star Destroyer looms overhead. Her father is next to her; shattered versions of him range from bitterness to dread to calculated rage as he watches the shadow consume the farm.
		- Maeryn: Split vision. Maeryn as a rebel leader, blood on her face, her father cutting her down with a vibroknife. Then, Maeryn as a decorated ISB officer, white uniform stained red as she cuts down her father with the same vibroknife.
		- The kid: a thousand Light, Dark, Blank futures. In most of the shards show the symbol of The Hidden Path, the old Jedi Order. These shards all come together, and a gray-hooded figure steps through. She says: "They heard you. They are coming for you. Stay Alive."
