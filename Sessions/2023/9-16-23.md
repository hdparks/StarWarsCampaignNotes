### Pre-session notes:

original dialogue:
The baby and I are safe. We are on our way to Concordia now. Is everything ready?

Yes. I have contacted Gar Saxon; soon I'll be free.  Then we'll get rid of that bastard Sabe and his rebel scum friends. Stay safe, mama.

## Post-Session Notes
- Players confronted the grandma about the encrypted message.
- They arrived at Concordia
- Ruus was freaking out, kinda squirrelly, wanted to roll over to Gar Saxon
- Skiira told Lance there were a handful who wanted to take out Saxon and thought this was the way to do it.
- Party went to Maya
- Lance tried to bluff and say they blew up Saxon. He addressed Maeryn by name, though, and Maya seemed to recognize her.
- Almost instinctually, Lance shot her through the chest
- [[Seb]] rushed in and asked "How will I raise our child?"
- Maya died in his arms
- To make it all worse, a bunch of [[Saxonite Mandalorians]] stop them before they can get away. (not that they wanted to leave, they were wanting to kill Saxon and kick off rebellion on [[Mandalore]].)
