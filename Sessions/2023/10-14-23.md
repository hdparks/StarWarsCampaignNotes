* New Hat + Armored Duster
	* When you ask around , everyone gives the same recommendation: The [[Neimoidian Haberdasherer Gree Nenda]], who _claims_ to have sold [[Cad Bane]] his first hat and duster, and has built a reputation for outfitting the greatest gunslingers in the galaxy. Word has it, he is due to stop by the Sunder within the next 2 weeks.
* Special Hand Cannon rounds
	* Nobody aboard the Sunder deals in the old-fashioned projectiles, and few of the smugglers or dealers have good leads on where they can be found. One shady lead does come up: An up-and-coming Trandoshan slaver gang has been known to deal in exotic slug throwers, and they were last seen harassing the hyperspace lanes near Kashyyyk. Could be worth looking into.
* Bomber jacket for Mae
	* You hear someone on the Sunder can get you exactly what you are asking for. Even better, the seller is an old ally: Tav, the smuggler who got you off Alderaan, and who first smuggled The Cube out of Hutt space. He promises to give you jacket in exchange for helping him on an upcoming delivery. "It's a quick and easy job, easiest score you'll ever make", he promises. He tells you to get in touch with him if you are interested. Until then, he's going to be lying low; having a Hutt on board the Sunder, even a lesser cousin like Qui'mara, has him a little on edge.
* Weapon upgrades
	* Speaking of the Hutt, you peruse the rows and rows of disorganized merchandise in Qui'mara's smoky tent. Most of it is junk, things they'd scavenged off the bodies of B1's after the Separatist army was shut down. Now, 10 years later, the good stuff is long gone.
