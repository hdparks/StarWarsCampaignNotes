[[Skiira]] has intel:
- Lance, things aren't good here.
- Because we let you escape, Saxon is choosing to punish the community at large
- He is forcefully conscripting half of the able-bodied population into the Supercommando program.
- We aren't going to let that happen.
- If we fight though, more will die.
- You owe us, Lance. And there's something you can do:
	-  Kyr'am Ijaat, Mandalorian Trial by Combat (literally "Death of honor")

## Post-session notes
The Behind the Scenes thing ([[Skiira and Alza Mereel]]) --- WAY TOO LONG! Shorten it down next time, then send it out in a text. Then, summarize in person. It's only cool if it's punchy.

Hobby is cool, and I think the Sunder is a cool location/mobile base/space battle future event with the [[Theseus]] once it gets patched up again.

Give Mae + non-combatants something to do in space battles. Intelligence--or charisma based stuff too--something more interesting than "I just look at everyone else doing their cool thing"

Dueling rules worked GREAT! I think the simplified Only d6, defender re-rolls, it all worked smoothly and still had great tension. at 5 dice, both dealt 50-60 dmg.

Gar Saxon failed all 3 death saves
