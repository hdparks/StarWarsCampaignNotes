#session 
### Pre-Session Planning
#### Scenes
- Brief description of entering the atmosphere of [[Scassin]]
- Landing pad
- Narrow alley, overhear conversations
	- "...haven't seen him, sorry. Maybe he got lucky and found some work mining the [[Aubergine comet cluster]]. Better chances there than here..."
	- "...his last dupe. If he doesn't win [[The Circuit]] this time, it's over for him--for good..."
	- "...something big is coming. The nerfs are skittish; they smell trouble on the wind..."
- Beautiful glowing obelisk of the [[Ninn Orthodoxy]], a Force-based religion. A fire roars within the structure, illuminating the veins of marble. A leathery shaman calls out to the party "be cleansed before ye enter the fine city of [[Phago]]".
- At a small kiosk nearby, another leathery being is handing out chips of wood and carving utensils. They explain to a small crowd the Ninn Cleansing Prayer, in which you carve your vice into the wood chip and cast it into the fire, freeing yourself from that burden.
	- Do any of you participate?

[[Alcazar Cantina]]
Who's there?
- [[Caidissa Harlay]]
- [[Jenth Iyabor]]
- [[ISB Handler Auger]]
- Barkeep (Toydarian)
- Flying Toydarian Ceiling Band
- Imperial Demolitions Experts (x2)
- Imperial Bodyguard
- Hutt militia
- Rebel militia
- Stormtrooper backup

How I want it to go:
* Whatever direction they decide to go, that party isn't there yet. But the other is!!
* Low tension. Our crew can process at their leisure.
	* If Maya is there, she will recognize undercover Imperial Demolitions Experts (x2) setting devices on the upper and lower levels.
* Maeryn gets hit on, possible confrontation.
* Roll to get the attention of either party.
* Caidissa hits on/taunts Lance. She is Jenth's hired muscle to make sure things go smoothly.
* (Now there's pressure to give it to Jenth)
* Auger gets a whisper from a girl in his booth, then makes eye contact with Maeryn, smiles, and winks.
	* If they go to him, he asks for the cube and a lock of hair.
* Throughout the early portions, other patrons of the bar will try to pickpocket each member of the party to get the cube. If any succeed, the group spots the thief as they reach the top of the stairwell.
* Once fighting begins, everything goes nutzo. Hutts + Caidissa + toydarian sniper from above + maybe Jenth from the pool hall, rebels in the main cantina, stormtroopers from the windows, and toydarians from above, all going HAM, all going after the cube.
