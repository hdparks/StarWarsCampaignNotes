## Theseus cutscene
* Crimson Dawn Flaghip, First Light, in orbit above [[Eriadu]]
- Theseus hails the First Light, fight breaks out
- Glitterstim pilots dance between turbolaser flak
- Deal solid hits, introduce [[Commander Holvin]], [[Boz Canata]], [[Boz's crew]]
- Boz & friends dodge snaps from Holvin's sickly yellow Zygerian Light Whip as they scramble to patch the holes that the snubfighters create.
	- Dex Save to dodge the whips
	- Technology check to fix gunner position
- "Boz, it's time. Those fighters are stimmed out of their mind. You've kept this hunk afloat for 2 years, but we've gotta get out. Now!"
- Holvin catches Janitor buddy, holds him down, screaming.
	- "Go, Boz! Go now!"
	- Holvin looks up with hatred, then realization and more hatred.
- Roll to escape!
- 4 maps
