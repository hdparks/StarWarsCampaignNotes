A Separatist Control Cube.

5/1/23 (ish)
[[Magganni "Mags"]] learned on [[Kardia]] that the cube may unlock upwards of 1 billion [[Experimental B3 Battle Droids]] hidden deep within the [[Uldaraan Nebula]].

#### [[7-13-23]]
[[Dryden Vos]] blackmailed [[Maya Amari]] to "deliver [[The Cube]] to [[Darth Vader]] on [[Mustafar]], and [[Seb's Kiddo]] will live."

[[Jenth Iyabor]] told [[Lance]] that he would return the [[Override Key]] to [[Lance's Prosthetics]] in exchange for bringing the cube straight to him in the [[Alcazar Cantina Pool Hall]].

[[ISB Handler Auger]] told [[Maeryn]] they would "wipe away the debt" if she brought the cube to the corner booth at the [[Alcazar Cantina]].

### Motivations

Why would [[Dryden Vos]] want [[Darth Vader]] to get [[The Cube]]?
What would Darth Vader do with the cube?
	Destroy it, and investigate where it came from and who got it originally (the Hutts) and punish them.
What if it had gone to the ISB, or some other entity in the Empire?
	ISB (if they understood) would have used it to start a shadow war (but on their own terms) in the Outer Rim corporate sector in Crimson Dawn territory.
Therefore, Dryden Vos needed it to get to Vader directly instead of the ISB to undercut their usefulness.
He doesn't want a full-scale war... Imperial peacetime is as profitable as anything he has had to deal with.

What would Dryden Vos do if he got the cube himself? Would he destroy it?
	He wouldn't want it. That thing is HOT right now, and he spends all his time trying to get things to cool off. He's a smuggler king, not a warmonger. He doesn't want anything traced back to him for any reason. Reaching out to [[Maya Amari]] was a gamble, but necessary since the [[ISB]] was about to realize what they had in them.
Darth Vader is a black hole--throw something at him, and that's the end of the story, even for the Hutts.
