## Backstory
(9/23/23)
Okay, hereâ€™s my thoughts so far for my character. Let me know if you think this will vibe or not.

Tara

Born on Ryloth, but her father took her and moved her off planet as a child to avoid her becoming a slave like her mother. They lived together on a farm and lived a very simple life, with one catch. Her dad taught her to use guns. Mostly for farming purposes but also to defend herself if someone tried to abduct her. As she grew up her dad trained her in more intense guns and sheâ€™s now a master sniper (she doesnâ€™t really recognize this at first, sheâ€™s only ever used this skill for hunting). 

I want her to be kind of quirky and clumsy. Shes really brave but often does dumb things like trips when the team is trying to be stealthy or drops important cargo, that kind of stuff. Sheâ€™s not ditsy or stupid, but definitely naive and innocent. Sheâ€™s super pure and fully believes in the rebellion. 
Think Anna from Frozenâ€¦. Just really in over her head but also ends up being as asset. 

Iâ€™m not sure storyline-wise how sheâ€™d come into the picture. But I want to keep her sniping abilities a secret at first. So somehow the group gets stuck with her and sheâ€™s clumsy and clueless and everybody is getting sick of her. But then some enemies show up and she insists on someone giving her a gun (which they obviously donâ€™t do because sheâ€™s been messing everything up). Eventually she takes one herself and snipes an enemy out of nowhere and nobody expects it ðŸ˜‚ but thatâ€™s literally her only strength.

Okay kyle and I have worked out a little bit more for Tara. 
So her dad was actually a really noteworthy warrior in the battle of ryloth and he wanted to escape that past and thatâ€™s why he took her to another planet. But she never knew this. One day in town she mouths off to a storm trooper and that gets her landed in jail. When they learn my name they realize sheâ€™s this guyâ€™s daughter so then the plan is to sell her into slavers but as a highly desirable slave because of my name. When her dad finds out he makes a distress call to the rebels d hats go the group gets set up to save her.
