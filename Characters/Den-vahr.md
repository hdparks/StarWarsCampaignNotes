Janitor aboard the Theseus
Presumed dead
Actually met up with the rebels

He knows [[Tiber Zahn]] is working with [[Commander Holvin]] to track down [[Boz]] and the escaped engineers.

Zahn is working with the empire in the Kardia sector to root out rebels and make way for the Uldaar hypermatter trade route in exchange for legitimacy. Allegedly. 

Zahn has also promised Holvin to track down the escaped engineers. One of them, [[Chaad Bufman]], has already been taken to the pirate hideout on an abandoned asteroid mining facility on the edge of the Uldaaran nebula.
