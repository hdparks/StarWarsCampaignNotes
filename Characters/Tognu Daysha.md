Originally left Ryloth when Empire took over.
"Retired"
Never stopped looking for his wife, sometimes taking odd jobs for his freedom fighting friends. Would leave for weeks at a time, but Tara just assumed he was doing deals or picking up supplies for the farm.
Meanwhile, he was killing generals, lieutenants, and politicians on behalf of his friends in the [[Free Ryloth Movement]], and later [[The Crimson Dawn]].
Instead of payment in credits, [[Tognu Daysha|Stillwater]] worked for information on [[Yulbo the Hutt]], the slaver who took [[Tara]]'s mother during the Separatist era on Ryloth.
