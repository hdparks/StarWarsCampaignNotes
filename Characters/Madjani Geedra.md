#badguy #character 
[[Crimson Dawn]] gangster with a mean streak. Jetpack, taunting, wicked smile, hobgoblinesque. He and his band of thugs were sent by [[Dryden Vos]] to kidnap/kill [[Seb's Kiddo]] after [[Maya Amari]] failed to bring [[The Cube]] to [[Darth Vader]].

[[Seb]] absolutely demolished him and his gang, at the cost of his connection to the Light side of the Force
