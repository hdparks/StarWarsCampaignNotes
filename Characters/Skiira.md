Originally: working with the [[Blood Stars]], under [[Senator Tiedus Amrena]].

After running into [[Lance]], she realized that [[Ruus]] was right about them all along and joined Lance's crew, helping them escape [[Kardia]]. She contacted [[Ruus]], who brought a detachment of Mandalorians in their dropships to create enough of a diversion to allow the crew to steal back [[The Cube]] from an ISB Star Destroyer. 

Skiira took [[Maya Amari|Maya]] back to [[Planets/Concordia|Concordia]], reuniting with [[Ruus]] and the [[The Followers of the Way]]. 

She didn't take kindly to the zealous followers. The same independence that drove her to leave Mandalore and join the Blood Stars was reinforced when she saw how small-minded and obsessed the holdouts had become. She was approached by a handful of Nite Owl loyalists who believed that the admonition to "protect fellow Mandalorians" extended beyond the few devotees to the old ways. They saw [[Gar Saxon]]'s actions under [[Maul]]'s Death Watch and in the overthrowing of [[Bo-Katan Kryze]] as cowardly, self-serving, and antithetical to The Way.
