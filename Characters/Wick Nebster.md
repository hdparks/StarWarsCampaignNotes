- Leader of the [[Iron Tangle]], a corporate-security force turned rebel cell that began as an offshoot of the [[Iktotchi Ironcore Colonial Conglomerate]]
- Superstitious to a fault. Specifically, Wick believed the [[Shabnak-adyr]], the vengeful steppe demon from the harsh, windy moon of Ictotch.
- Wick Nebster owned and operated the bar on his flagship that also acted as his trophy room. One such trophy was his [[Imperial Transmitter]] that was able to send messages inside the Empire's own network.
- His wife, [[Lucia Marr Fey'lia Nebster]], the youngest daughter of the powerful Fey'lia family, has given the Colonial Conglomerate a significant foothold in this portion of the galaxy
- Unfortunately, Lucia's allegiance is to herself and her family frist, as Wick learned too late.
