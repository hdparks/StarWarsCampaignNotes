#character #badguy 
Jerk engineer who holds the [[Override Key]] to [[Lance's Prosthetics]]. 

### Backstory
[[Jenth Iyabor]] blackmailed and bullied [[Lance]] for several years before the campaign began.

### Archetype
Narcissistic Tech-bro who blames the Empire for the fact that his crypto startup failed. A Tom-level genius, if you will. Just smart enough to be worth keeping around, plus he and the [[Rebellion Leader]] go way back.

Is super down bad for [[Caidissa Harlay]].

Is pretty much a scumbag.
